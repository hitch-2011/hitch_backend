# Hitch Backend

This is the backend engine fueling Hitch, a web application that connects users to similar routes and can help get vehicles off the road. The application is built with service oriented architecture and this app does most of the heavy lifting (see [Project Architecture](#project-architecture)). The backend communicates with the frontend using 5 API JSON endpoints. It stores all our information in our databases.

The API endpoints allow other apps to store Users, Ridedays, Rides, Vehciles, and Friends.  There is functionality on the backend to find matching routes requests all the zipcodes near your specific destination/origin and grabs users with matching routes in those specific areas.

To get zipcodes within a specified radius, please visit the radius microservice.

To check driveable routes we used mapquest api.

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. Endpoints can be added. If you plan to use this engine with the frontend web application, if the endpoints are changed subsequent updates will be necessary on the Frontend repository code.

#### Prerequisites

* __Ruby__

  - The project is built with rubyonrails using __ruby version 2.5.3p105__, you must install ruby on your local machine first. Please visit the [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) home page to get set up. _Please ensure you install the version of ruby noted above._

* __Rails__
  ```sh
  gem install rails --version 5.2.5
  ```

* __Postgres database__
  - Visit the [postgresapp](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html) homepage and follow their instructions to download the latest version of Postgres app.

#### Frontend dependancies

#### Installing

1. Clone the repo
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/Yardsourcing/yardsourcing-frontend
  ```

2. Bundle Install
  ```
  $ bundle install
  ```

3. Create, migrate and seed rails database
  ```
  $ rails db:{create,migrate,seed}
  ```

4. Set up Environment Variables:
  - run `bundle exec figaro install`
  - add the below variable to the `config/application.yml` if you wish to use the existing email microservice. Otherwise you replace it the value with service if desired.
  ```
    EMAIL_MICROSERVICE: 'https://peaceful-bastion-57477.herokuapp.com'
  ```

  If you do not wish to use the sample data provided to seed your database, replace the commands in `db/seeds.rb`.

for example: `bundle exec rspec spec/features/host/dashboard/index_spec.rb`

### How to Contribute

In the spirit of collaboration, things done together are better than done on our own. If you have any amazing ideas or contributions on how we can improve this API they are **greatly appreciated**. To contribute:

  1. Fork the Project
  2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
  3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
  4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
  5. Open a Pull Request

### Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/hitch-2011/hitch_backend/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues). Please open an issue ticket if you see an existing error or bug.
